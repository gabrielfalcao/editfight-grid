- 0 front-end dependencies

### Rationale

Reddit's r/place was a really cool concept but I never got to play it. So I
wanted to see how little I needed in order to remake something like it myself.

### Technical details

The source is designed assuming there's only one server. All clients connect to
it and all it mainly does is share state through all clients using websockets.
Each client recreates all the state on its own.

Since there's only 16 colors (intentionally), each pixel in the 100x100 grid can
be represented by a single hex-encoded byte. So every time a client connects,
the server sends it a 10,000-character string representing the grid.

I used [gifenc](https://github.com/lecram/gifenc/) to create the time-lapse
gifs, which was surprisingly simple to use, and pretty fast too.

### Upcoming features

- [ ] Better color palette. Maybe like 7 colors and 4-5 variations of them. More like a grid.
- [ ] Zoom and grid buttons should have icons and not words.
- [ ] Button that shows/hide a shortcut list.
- [ ] Thumbnail preview when zoomed in.
- [ ] Say that itâ€™s loading instead of just looking broken...
- [ ] The toolbar and color chooser should be separate.
- [ ] Maybe a way to resize chat box or something so you can see more.
- [ ] /warn feature for griefers
- [ ] Show user explanation when kicked.
- [ ] Try some compression of initial data for faster loading time. See if it helps on super-slow connections.
